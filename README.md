## Hi, I'm Diksha Nagpal

<!--


I'm a B.Tech student passionate about software development and building real-world applications. I have hands-on experience with Java and Python, and I've worked on various projects such as a password generator, word guessing game, and a weather forecast app using APIs.

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring mobile app development and enhancing my understanding of application design, UI/UX, and data handling.

This GitHub profile showcases my learning journey, problem-solving approach, and commitment to writing clean, functional code. I'm always eager to collaborate, take on new challenges, and grow as a developer.
